polymorph -- filename convertor
==================================

must fix:
----------------------------------
  nothing -- works pretty well right now...

wishlist:
----------------------------------
* -r command line switch to recurse directories

* a "~/.polymorphrc" file with the specific file extensions
you want to convert listed and editable

* implement the --long_options for the command line

* -e command line switch to exclude filenames of a given
extension

* -j command line switch to convert just files of a given
extension
