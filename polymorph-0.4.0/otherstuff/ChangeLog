Changes to polymorph:
=======================================

v0.4.0 --
        fixed all the Windows clean-up bugs I could find.
	no manpage yet.  I hate manpages.  'polymorph -h' is your friend
	
v0.3.1 --
	name changed to 'polymorph' after sourceforge.net and 
	freshmeat.net lost the original 'golem' name and gave it to a new 
	windowmanager.  I'm not bitter.  I'll just rename and keep going.
	If you like windowmanagers, golem is kind of pretty...
	
	bugfix release.  There were a bunch of warnings that got cleaned
	up in llist.c and rcfile.c, mostly having to do with linked list
	type casting.

	polymorph now works, although without recursion...  I'm working on
	it, as well as a manpage.
	
v0.3 --
       added the -c command line switch.  This will make polymorph rename
       the target file to just the portion of it's current name after the
       last backslash character.

v0.2 --
       added the -a command line switch.  Tried running polymorph in my
       home directory and converted my .Xdefaults to lowercase by
       accident.  Now, you can make polymorph convert hidden files
       specifically, but it's going to ignore them if left to its own
       devices.

       added the -t command line switch to 'track' symlinks.  Now, with
       the -t switch, polymorph will track a symlink to it's destination
       file and change it's name.

       added more documentation

v0.1 --
       initial implementation
