* httpd-2.0.48
program description:
---------------------
Open source Apache HTTP Server
(The code is downloaded from apache website)

bug explanation:
--------------------
Data Race (Atomicity Violation)
modules/loggers/mod_log_config.c; in function ap_buffered_log_writer

static apr_status_t ap_buffered_log_writer(..,void *handle,..)
{
  ...
  buffered_log *buf = (buffered_log*)handle;
  ...
  for (i = 0, s = &buf->outbuf[buf->outcnt]; i < nelts; ++i) {
            memcpy(s, strs[i], strl[i]);
            s += strl[i];
  }
  buf->outcnt += len;
  ...
}

In above code, the application tries to append new information to the log 
buffer (buf), and update the buffer index (buf->outcnt) afterwards. However,
since the buffer writing action and the buffer index update action are not
properly protected into one critical action. It is possible that: two threads
both write to the buffer and interfere with each other's buffer index update.
As a result, the server log (buf) is corrupted.

Furthermore, the line 'buf->outcnt += len' is a typical data race. Thinking it as
temp = buf->outcnt;
buf->outcnt = temp+len;
Interleaving above two sentences will similarly cause server log corrupted.

How to repeat the bug:
---------------------
1. You can add sleep or yield before above 'buf->outcnt += len' code in the 
function ¡°ap_buffered_log_writer¡± of the file ¡°modules/loggers/mod_log_config.c¡±
to ease the bug repeat. Code range is around line 1363.
2. Configure the httpd-2.0.48 as follows: ¡°./configure --prefix = ¡­ --with-mpm=worker¡±
  , build and install the httpd.
3. add one line to the configuration file ¡°conf/httpd.conf¡±: ¡°BufferedLogs on¡±
4. then use two clients to fetch different files. For example, you can issue 
  following two httperf requests
  1) ./httperf  --server=<your server name>  --uri=/index.html.cz.iso8859-2 \
  --num-conns=100 --num-calls=100
  2) ¡°./httperf  --server=<your server name>  --uri=/index.html.en \
  --num-conns=100 --num-calls=100

If the bug is triggered, you¡¯ll see the garbage in the access log file 
¡°logs/access_log¡±

correct inputs:
