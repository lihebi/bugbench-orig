* squid-2.3
program description:
---------------------
Open source Squid Web Proxy Cache
(The code is downloaded from Squid website)

bug explanation:
--------------------
heap overflow
(Refer to http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5BP0P2A6AY.html)
ftp.c in function ftpBuildTitleUrl

static void
ftpBuildTitleUrl(FtpStateData * ftpState)
{
    request_t *request = ftpState->request;
    size_t len;
    char *t;
    len = 64
       + strlen(ftpState->user)
       + strlen(ftpState->password)
       + strlen(request->host)
       + strLen(request->urlpath);

  ...
    t = xcalloc (len, 1);
    strcat(t, "ftp://");
    if (strcmp(ftpState->user, "anonymous")) {
       strcat(t, rfc1738_escape_part(ftpState->user));
       if (ftpState->password_url) {
           strcat(t, ":");
           strcat(t, rfc1738_escape_part(ftpState->password));
       }
       strcat(t, "@");
    }

  ...
}

t is a heap buffer, allocated to hold the input request.
Squid allocates the buffer based on its buffer length (variable len) 
calculation, which is wrong.
The calculation does not consider special characters in the url, in which case,
the allocated buffer is small and causes heap buffer overflow.


bug triggering input:
---------------------
ftp requests with large number of special characters ('\ ' in above example) 
would probably trigger the bug. Following is an example:

0. install the squid
1. launch Squid server 
2. run following client request
./client ftp://username\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \:password@host.com


correct inputs:
--------------------
too many

bug detection preliminary results:
--------------------
Purify and Valgrind can both catch the bug
