* CVS 1.11.4
program description:
---------------------
Open source Version Control Software
(The code is downloaded from GNU website)

bug explanation:
--------------------
double free
a static pointer: dir_name, it is freed and reallocated in
src/server.c line 992. The problem of following code is: even if
freeed, the dir_name is not set to NULL, so next time, it will be
freed again
buggy code:
static void dirswitch (dir, repos)
    char *dir;
    char *repos;
{
  ...
 if (dir_name != NULL)
    free (dir_name);
  ...
  dir_name = xmalloc(...)
  ...
}


bug triggering input:
---------------------
Two choices:
One: look at the exploiting code in exploit-cvs.c

or 

Two: try following after logged into cvs, issue the following commands to cvs 
repeatedly for several times, bug will be triggered.
	     Argument Crhi\n
	     Argument $mod_name\n
	     Directory .\n
	     $cvsroot\n
	     export\n

	     Directory t2\n
	     $cvsroot\n
	     Directory ./\n
	     $cvsroot\n
	     noop\n

correct inputs:
--------------------
too many

bug detection preliminary results:
--------------------
Purify and Valgrind can both catch the bug
