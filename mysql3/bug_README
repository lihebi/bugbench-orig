* mysql-4.1.1
program description:
---------------------
Open source Database Server 
(The code is downloaded from MySQL website)

bug explanation:
--------------------
Atomicity violation (Data Race)
(Refer to http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2011)
sql/slave.cc; in function next_event

in function next_event, around line 4044, there is a 'check_binlog_magic'.
This function call and preceding part of this function should not be 
interleaved by conflicting access from other threads. However, they are
not properly protected into one critical section and may be interleaved.
The interleaving may cause server crash.

bug triggering input:
---------------------
To ease repeating the bug, you can add a 'sleep' right before the
check_binlog_magic in the next_event function. 

Then run the rpl_max_relay_size.test:
./mysql-test-run rpl_max_relay_size.test

Afte a while, you will probably get error information and be informed that 
'could not sync with master' and 'Aborting: rpl_max_relay_size failed'.
This means you have triggered the bug and crashed the server.

correct inputs:
--------------------
too many
